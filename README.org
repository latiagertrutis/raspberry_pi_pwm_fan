* PWM fan control for Raspberry pi
Simple fan control program using pulse width modulation with bcm2835 library.

** Prerequisites
You will need to install [[https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/][bcm2835 library]] in order to compile the program.

** Installation
A Makefile is in charge to build and install.

*Building*:
#+begin_example
make
#+end_example

*Building for debug*:
#+begin_example
make debug
#+end_example

*Installing in your raspberry*:
#+begin_example
sudo make install
#+end_example

This will compile and install the binary in your system, then you will need to enable and start the service so it will automatically go up on startup.

#+begin_example
sudo systemctl enable pwm_fan.service
sudo systemctl start pwm_fan.service
#+end_example

** Electronics
For the circuit I took the schema from: [[https://www.instructables.com/id/PWM-Regulated-Fan-Based-on-CPU-Temperature-for-Ras/][https://www.instructables.com/id/PWM-Regulated-Fan-Based-on-CPU-Temperature-for-Ras/]].
